Problem statement - the diabetes dataset has pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, outcome. In this dataset find the dependent and independent variable and write codes for decision tree algorithm by taking training size is 70% and remaining data for testing and check the accuracy of model.



Tools used – pandas, sklearn, label encoder, decision tree, matplotlib, seaborn etc.



Outcome – the accuracy of decision tree machine learning algorithm is 67% here predicted variable is outcome.47 and 108 values true positive and 37 and 39 false positive classes.
